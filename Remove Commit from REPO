Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a **simple, step-by-step guide** for removing any commit from any git project, using the safest and most modern method (`git filter-repo`).  
I‚Äôll also include what to do if you get common errors.  
You can always copy-paste these steps and just swap out the commit hashes you want to remove.

## üìù How to Remove Any Commit From Any Git Project (Step-by-Step)

### **1. Find the Commit Hashes You Want to Remove**
Open your terminal in your repo‚Äôs folder and run:
```sh
git log --oneline
```
Copy the short hash (like `a1b2c3d`) or the full hash you want to delete.

---

### **2. Make a Backup (Just In Case)**
Always copy your project folder before big changes!  
For example:
```sh
cd ..
cp -r your-project your-project-backup
cd your-project
```

---

### **3. Make a Fresh Clone (Recommended for Safety)**
This helps avoid errors and keeps your main repo safe.  
In a folder outside your current project, run:
```sh
git clone --mirror https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git your-repo-clean.git
cd your-repo-clean.git
```
Replace the URL and folder name with your repo details.

### **4. Remove the Commit(s) With filter-repo**
If you don‚Äôt have `git-filter-repo`, install it:
```sh
pip install git-filter-repo
```
or
```sh
brew install git-filter-repo
```

Now run this command (replace `yourcommit1` and `yourcommit2` with your hashes):
```sh
git filter-repo --commit-callback "
    if commit.original_id == b'yourcommit1' or commit.original_id == b'yourcommit2':
        commit.skip()
"
```
**If you get an error like**  
`Aborting: Refusing to destructively overwrite repo history...`  
**add `--force` at the end:**
```sh
git filter-repo --force --commit-callback "
    if commit.original_id == b'yourcommit1' or commit.original_id == b'yourcommit2':
        commit.skip()
"
```
**If it says the remote was removed**, re-add it:
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

---

### **5. Push Your Cleaned History Back to GitHub**
This will overwrite history, so everyone must re-clone after!
```sh
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

---

### **6. Check That the Commits Are Gone**
Run:
```sh
git log --oneline --all | Select-String 'yourcommit1|yourcommit2'
```
**No output = Success!**

---

### **7. Tell Collaborators**
Let anyone who works with you know they MUST re-clone the repo, because history has changed.

|------|------------|----------------------|----------|
| 1 | Find commit hash | - | - |
| 2 | Make a backup | - | - |
| 3 | Make a fresh clone | - | - |
| 4 | Run filter-repo | ‚ÄúRefusing to destructively overwrite‚Ä¶‚Äù | Add `--force` |
|   |                | ‚Äúorigin does not appear to be a git repo‚Äù | Add remote with `git remote add origin ...` |
| 5 | Force-push | - | - |
| 6 | Check history | If output shows commit | Repeat step 4 with correct hash |

## **Quick Copy-Paste Example**

For commits `abc1234` and `def5678`:
```sh
git filter-repo --force --commit-callback "
    if commit.original_id == b'abc1234' or commit.original_id == b'def5678':
        commit.skip()
"
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```
