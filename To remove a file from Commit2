Steps to remove a file (e.g., DEPLOYMENT.md) from your entire Git history using git filter-repo:

## Simple Steps to Remove a File from All Commits

### 1. Install git-filter-repo (only once, if you don’t have it)
- On Windows:  
  Download from https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/releases and add to your PATH  
  Or run:  
  ```sh
  pip install git-filter-repo
  ```

### 2. Clone your repo as a mirror
```sh
git clone --mirror https://github.com/Ihsaan7/Mini_Ecomm-w-Backend-.git
cd Mini_Ecomm-w-Backend-.git
```

### 3. Remove the file from all history
```sh
git filter-repo --path DEPLOYMENT.md --invert-paths
```

### 4. Add the remote (if needed)
```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/Ihsaan7/Mini_Ecomm-w-Backend-.git
```

### 5. Push changes (force push!)
```sh
git push --force --all origin
git push --force --tags origin
```

## Important Notes:
- This changes your entire repo history! Tell all collaborators—they’ll need to re-clone the repo.
- Replace DEPLOYMENT.md with any other file you want to erase from history.
